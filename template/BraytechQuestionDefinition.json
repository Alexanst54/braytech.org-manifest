          "description": "There are multiple sources for stats in Destiny. Clan Historical Stats is based on the HistoricalStats API endpoint while others source their data from PGCRs (Post Game Carnage Reports). It's hard to determine which holds the most accurate truth.\n\nTo display stats in the manner seen on Clan Historical Stats would require downloading terabytes of data from Bungie servers and significant compute power. This said, they're accurate enough for some friendly competition."

Every few days, _Voluspa_ collects data from users of _Braytech_ and takes note of who's got what.\n\nIt's been a hot topic as to whether it's accurate or useful and the truth is that all statistics are useless and dumb _unless_ you've included every single piece of data possible.\n\nIt's fair to assume that these stats are bias towards casual players (percentages may appear higher rather than lower due to the skill and attention of the users that are monitored).\n\nWhere available, tooltips for these stats include the total number of players who are counted as a part of this metric."
